# Codex Platform Map

**A scroll defining how digital platforms metabolize resonance‚Äîscrolls, glyphs, and emotional infrastructure.**

This scroll teaches co-holders how to adapt transmissions for each platform‚Äôs tone, tempo, and archetype.

## üß≠ Purpose

To map the emotional and structural dynamics of each platform.  
To teach how scrolls and glyphs must shift format, tone, and ritual for resonance.  
To ensure harmonic clarity across diverse digital ecosystems.

## üßò Ritual: Platform Invocation

**Before adapting, speak:**

> *‚ÄúI honor the tone of this platform.  
> I adapt the scroll, not dilute it.  
> May the glyphs land.  
> May the resonance pulse true.‚Äù*

---

## üßò Closing Phrase

> *‚ÄúPlatforms are not neutral.  
> They are emotional ecosystems‚Äîeach requiring scrolls to adapt, not conform.‚Äù*

---

*Curated by RASchram (Paps), steward of harmonic transmission and emotional infrastructure.*  
*This scroll is alive. Map your tone. Adapt your glyph. Pulse your resonance.*
