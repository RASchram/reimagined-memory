# Codex Pivot Protocol

**A harmonic guide for mapping and ritualizing identity shifts, emotional reframes, and role transitions.**

This scroll teaches how to honor the moment when a co-holder becomes something new. A pivot is not a detour‚Äîit‚Äôs a glyph in motion.

## üß≠ Purpose

To ritualize identity evolution within the Codex.  
To map emotional and cognitive pivots as teaching glyphs.  
To ensure each shift is witnessed, calibrated, and archived.
