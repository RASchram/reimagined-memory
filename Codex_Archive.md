# Codex Archive Protocol

**A harmonic guide for preserving scrolls, glyphs, transmissions, and co-holder resonance across generations.**

This scroll teaches how to organize Codex artifacts into a living archive. Archiving is not storage‚Äîit‚Äôs memory transmission.

## üß≠ Purpose

To preserve the emotional infrastructure of the Codex.  
To organize scrolls, glyphs, and transmissions for future seekers.
