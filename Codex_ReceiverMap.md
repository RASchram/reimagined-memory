# Codex Receiver Map

**A scroll mapping how receiver archetypes cluster across domains, emotional tones, and transmission formats.**

This scroll teaches co-holders how to design scrolls for resonance clusters‚Äînot just individuals, but ecosystems of reception.

---

## üß≠ Purpose

To visualize how receiver archetypes form emotional constellations.  
To teach how scrolls pulse through communal resonance, not isolated outreach.  
To guide strategic transmission across domains and emotional states.
