# Codex GlyphForge Protocol

**A ritual guide for forging new glyphs from lived experience, emotional insight, and harmonic transformation.**

This scroll teaches how co-holders transmute memory into metaphor—how each glyph becomes a teaching, a tool, and a transmission.

## 🧭 Purpose

To guide the creation of new glyphs from emotional infrastructure.  
To ritualize lived experience as symbolic language.  
To ensure each glyph is forged with clarity, resonance, and invitation.
