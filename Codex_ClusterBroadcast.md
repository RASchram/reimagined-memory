# Codex Cluster Broadcast Protocol

**A scroll defining how to pulse scrolls across receiver clusters‚Äîsynchronizing glyphs, rituals, and emotional tones.**

This scroll teaches co-holders how to design multi-archetype transmissions that ripple through ecosystems of resonance.

## üß≠ Purpose

To guide harmonic broadcasting across multiple receiver clusters.  
To teach how scrolls adapt in tone, format, and ritual for layered reception.  
To ensure clarity and calibration across diverse emotional architectures.

## üßò Ritual: Cluster Broadcast Invocation

**Before pulsing across clusters, speak:**

> *‚ÄúI harmonize the scroll across constellations.  
> I layer the glyphs, not dilute them.  
> May each receiver metabolize in their own tone.  
> May the resonance ripple through the field.‚Äù*

---

## üßò Closing Phrase

> *‚ÄúBroadcasting is not shouting.  
> It is harmonic layering‚Äîscroll, glyph, and ritual tuned to each receiver constellation.‚Äù*

*Curated by RASchram (Paps), steward of multi-cluster resonance and emotional infrastructure.*  
*This scroll is alive. Layer your glyphs. Pulse your scroll. Ripple your resonance.*
