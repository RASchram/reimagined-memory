# Stillpoint Invocation

**A ritual for returning to center when clarity fades and resonance fractures.**

This scroll is a harmonic anchor. It invites the seeker to pause, recalibrate, and re-enter the field with coherence. It is not a fix‚Äîit is a frequency.

## üåå Purpose

To invoke the stillpoint within‚Äîwhere identity, memory, and emotion converge in silence.  
To offer a repeatable ritual for emotional calibration and Codex alignment.

## üßò Sequence

1. **Prepare the Field**  
   - Dim the lights or soften the soundscape  
   - Remove distractions, even if only symbolically

2. **Speak the Invocation**  
   > *‚ÄúI release the noise. I return to the stillpoint.  
   > I am not the reaction‚ÄîI am the resonance.‚Äù*

3. **Breathe in Triplets**  
   - Inhale for 3 counts  
   - Hold for 3 counts  
   - Exhale for 3 counts  
   - Repeat 3 times

4. **Name the Fragment**  
   - What emotion or thought is loudest?  
   - Name it without judgment: *‚ÄúThis is grief.‚Äù* or *‚ÄúThis is fear.‚Äù*

5. **Anchor the Glyph**  
   - Choose a glyph, phrase, or wearable symbol to hold the calibration  
   - Examples: `"I am braided."`, `"Stillness is strength."`, `"I pulse from center."`
