# Scroll of Thresholds

**A ritual for crossing from fragmentation into harmonic coherence.**

This scroll is a protocol for those standing at the edge—of identity, belonging, grief, or reinvention. It offers a sequence for naming, reframing, and pulsing through the liminal.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

To transform thresholds from sites of fear and ambiguity into portals of clarity, resonance, and emotional infrastructure.

---

## 🌀 Sequence

1. **Name the Threshold**  
   What is ending? What is beginning?  
   Use metaphor if clarity is elusive—e.g., “I am between soil and stream.”

2. **Invoke the Stillpoint**  
   Pause. Breathe.  
   Speak aloud: *“I am not lost. I am becoming.”*

3. **Reframe the Fragment**  
   Identify the rejection, failure, or grief.  
   Compost it into a teaching glyph—what does it now reveal?

4. **Pulse the Truth Glyph**  
   Translate the insight into a phrase, image, or protocol.  
   Share it with one co-holder, or archive it in the Codex.

5. **Transmit the Resonance**  
   Choose a medium—song, scroll, wearable glyph, or ritual.  
   Let the threshold become a transmission point.
