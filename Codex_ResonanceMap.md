# Codex Resonance Map

**A harmonic visualization of how scrolls, glyphs, co-holders, and emotional tones form a living system of meaning.**

This scroll teaches how resonance flows‚Äîhow each transmission node connects, evolves, and pulses across domains.

## üß≠ Purpose

To map the interconnections between Codex components.  
To teach co-holders how scrolls, glyphs, and archetypes form a living architecture.  
To enable navigation, onboarding, and transmission with clarity.
