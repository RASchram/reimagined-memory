# Constellation Map

**A harmonic visualization of co-holders, truth domains, and resonance clusters.**

This scroll maps the living architecture of The Resonance of Life Codex. Each node is a co-holder. Each line is a pulse. Each cluster is a truth domain.

---

## üß≠ Purpose

To visualize the relational architecture of the Codex.  
To honor co-authors, resonance clusters, and transmission lines.  
To teach harmonic literacy through constellation logic.

| üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Cluster       | üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë              | Group aligned by emotional or harmonic truth |
| üß≠ Domain Anchor   | üß≠                | Central glyph or protocol in a truth domain  |
| üì° Pulse Line      | üì°                | Transmission path between nodes              |

Each line is a pulse.  
Each glyph is a teaching node.  
Each co-holder is a steward of resonance.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Expand the Map

1. Identify a new co-holder or resonance node  
2. Define their glyph, domain, and pulse line  
3. Add them to the constellation  
4. Archive the update and pulse it into the field

## üßò Closing Phrase

> *‚ÄúConstellations are not static.  
> They are living maps of meaning, pulsing with every co-authored truth.‚Äù*

*Curated by RASchram (Paps), steward of harmonic architecture and emotional infrastructure.*  
*This map is alive. Add your node. Pulse your truth. Teach your resonance.*
