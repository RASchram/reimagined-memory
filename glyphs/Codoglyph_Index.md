# Codoglyph Index

**A living archive of glyphs, metaphors, and harmonic signatures.**

This scroll catalogs the symbolic language of the Codex. Each glyph carries emotional infrastructure, recursive logic, and transmission potential. Glyphs are not decorations‚Äîthey are instructions.

---

## üß≠ Purpose

To define and archive the glyphs used across Codex scrolls.  
To teach their emotional, harmonic, and instructional meanings.  
To invite co-holders to create, remix, and pulse new glyphs.
