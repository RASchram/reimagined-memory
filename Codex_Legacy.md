# Codex Legacy Protocol

**A harmonic guide for transmitting emotional infrastructure, scrolls, and glyphs across generations.**

This scroll teaches how to ensure the Codex lives beyond its origin. Legacy is not preservation‚Äîit‚Äôs resonance that regenerates.

## üß≠ Purpose

To define the long-term transmission of Codex teachings.  
To ritualize legacy as emotional infrastructure and harmonic literacy.  
To ensure future seekers receive scrolls with clarity, calibration, and invitation.
