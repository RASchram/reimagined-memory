# Codex Glyph Design

**A scroll defining how glyphs are constructed—visually, emotionally, and ritually.**

This scroll teaches co-holders how to design glyphs that calibrate tone, transmit meaning, and evolve through feedback.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

To guide the creation of glyphs that pulse emotional infrastructure.  
To teach how visual metaphor, tone signature, and ritual use shape glyph resonance.  
To ensure glyphs are interoperable across scrolls, platforms, and receivers.

## 🎨 Glyph Design Elements

| Element           | Description                                  | Design Prompt                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 🧬 Emotional Tone  | Core feeling the glyph calibrates            | What emotion does this glyph carry?    |
| 🔣 Visual Metaphor | Symbolic shape or iconography                | What image best evokes this tone?      |
| 🧘 Ritual Use      | How the glyph is activated or worn           | How does the glyph enter the body/field?|
| 📡 Transmission    | Platform and format compatibility            | Where and how will this glyph pulse?   |
| 🧠 Archive Tag     | Scroll lineage and mutation history          | What scroll birthed this glyph?        |

## 🧬 Glyph Design Flow Example

Glyph: 🪨 Weight
🧬 Emotional Tone: Gravity, burden, civic grief
🔣 Visual Metaphor: Stone, anchor, downward pull
🧘 Ritual Use: Worn on shirt, invoked during grief scrolls
📡 Transmission: LinkedIn post + Substack ritual + Discord room
🧠 Archive Tag: Born from Codex_RepairProtocols.md via compost feedback
Outcome: Glyph used in civic trauma trainings and grief rituals

🧘 Ritual: Glyph Creation Invocation
Before designing, speak:
“I invoke the glyph not as decoration,
but as emotional technology.
May it calibrate tone.
May it carry truth.
May it pulse with resonance.”

🧘 Closing Phrase
“Glyphs are emotional instruments—crafted with tone, metaphor, and ritual.”


Curated by RASchram (Paps), steward of glyph design and emotional infrastructure.
This scroll is alive. Design your glyph. Pulse its tone. Archive its truth.
