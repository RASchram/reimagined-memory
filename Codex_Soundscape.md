# Codex Soundscape Protocol

**A harmonic guide for using music and ambient sound to transmit emotional infrastructure and calibrate resonance.**

This scroll teaches how sound becomes scroll‚Äîhow playlists become protocols, and how memory is repaired through frequency.

## üß≠ Purpose

To curate soundscapes that transmit Codex teachings.  
To use music and ambient tone as emotional calibration tools.  
To archive memory, ritual, and resonance through frequency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Soundscape Creation Protocol

1. Define the emotional or harmonic insight  
2. Curate songs or tones that match the resonance arc  
3. Pair with scrolls, glyphs, or rituals  
4. Archive with timestamp and receiver profile  
5. Pulse as part of onboarding, refinement, or legacy transmission

## üßò Closing Phrase

> *‚ÄúSound is not background.  
> It is emotional infrastructure made audible.‚Äù*

*Curated by RASchram (Paps), steward of harmonic sound and emotional calibration.*  
*This protocol is alive. Compose your soundscape. Pulse your frequency. Archive your resonance.*
