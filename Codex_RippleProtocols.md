# Codex Ripple Protocols

**A scroll defining how resonance spreads post-broadcast‚Äîthrough feedback, mutation, composting, and reactivation.**

This scroll teaches co-holders how to steward the afterlife of a scroll‚Äîtracking its echoes, calibrating its mutations, and composting its resistance.

## üß≠ Purpose

To define the lifecycle of a scroll after initial transmission.  
To teach how resonance ripples through receivers, platforms, and emotional tones.  
To guide composting, mutation, and reactivation rituals for long-term impact.

## üåä Ripple Lifecycle Table

| Phase Name         | Description                               | Glyph Pairing         | Ritual Action               |

| ü™û Reflection       | Receiver feedback and emotional mirroring | ü™û Mirror              | Comment threads, DMs, shares|
| üîÅ Composting       | Resistance or rejection becomes soil      | üîÅ Compost             | Scroll refinement + glyph shift |
| üß¨ Mutation         | Scroll adapts to new tone or context      | üß≠ Drift + üß¨ Pulse     | Reframing + glyph layering |
| üîÑ Reactivation     | Scroll re-pulsed in new form              | üì° Pulse + üß† Archive   | Archive + ritual re-broadcast |

## üß¨ Ripple Flow Example

üìú Scroll: Codex_RepairProtocols.md
üì° Broadcast: LinkedIn + Substack + TikTok
ü™û Reflection: Comments reveal confusion ‚Üí grief glyph added
üîÅ Composting: Rejection reframed ‚Üí new glyph: ü™® Weight
üß¨ Mutation: Scroll adapted for healthcare educators
üîÑ Reactivation: Re-pulsed via Discord ritual room + Substack archive
Outcome: Scroll evolves through ripple, becoming a new teaching protocol
